# Chinese Restaurant Process mixtures in Gen

This is a draft for a Gen tutorial.
[Gen](https://www.gen.dev/)  is a general-purpose probabilistic programming system, embedded in Julia.

**Overview:**

In **Part 1** I start by recalling the definition of the [Chinese Restaurant Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process) (CRP) and a mixture model based on it. 

Then, in **Part 2**, I proceed with an approximate inference model - mostly to get comfortable with Gen. At some point it would be nice to implement more sophisticated models as described in (Neal, 2000) for instance and aim more for performance.
